# loops are used to repeat instructions

a = 4
b = 5

i = 1
while i <= 5  :       #while is iterator
    print('hello world')  #this process is iteration
    i += 1

print(i)

# Break & continue :

# break : used to terminate the loop when encounterd

# continue : terminates execution in the current iteration &continues execution of the loop with the next iteration


# For Loops :

# loops are used for sequenital travesal.for traversing list,string,tuples etc.

list = [1,2,3,4,5]

for val in list :
    print(val)
else: 
    print('hello')

# Range functions return a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default,and increment by 1 by default
# syntax :
# range(start?,stop,step?)\

print(range(5))


# Pass statement
